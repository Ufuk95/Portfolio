    <h2>3. Data collection on our website</h2>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help
      make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your
      computer and saved by your browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other
      cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser
      when you next visit the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis
      whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies
      under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser.
      Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.
    </p>

    <h3>Server log files</h3>
    <p>
      The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in
      "server log files". These are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
      <li>Operating system used</li>
      <li>Referrer URL</li>
      <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
      <li>Time of the server request</li>
      <li>IP address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data will not be combined with data from other sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or
      for measures preliminary to a contract.
    </p>

    <h3>Contact form</h3>
    <p>
      Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the
      contact details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share this information
      without your permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO.
      You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed
      before we receive your request may still be legally processed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its
      storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g., after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory
      statutory provisions, especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this
      provision.

    <h2>4. Plugins and tools</h2>

    <h3>Google Web Fonts</h3>
    <p>
      For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser
      loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this purpose, your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google's servers. Google thus becomes aware
      that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a uniform
      and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further information about handling user data, can be found at
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and in Google's

      To use Google Maps, it is necessary to save your IP address. This information is generally transmitted to a Google
